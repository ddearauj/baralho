# Objective

The most important thing at the start is to have a clear goal.
The idea here is quite simple:

Card game that has all the custom rules I use to play with my friends.
The game must then have:

- Deck of cards
- Player
    - hand

- Board
    - Cards on board
    - Turn?

- Ability to create game rules easily:
    - Presidente
    - Fodinha
    - Truco
    - Napo




## To-dos:

- Order cards in player hand given a set of possible orderings (might depend on game)
